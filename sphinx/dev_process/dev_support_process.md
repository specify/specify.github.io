## Steps to Submit and Resolve a Support Request

1. Send a request to **Caroline** on Slack describing the issue.
2. Once approved, the **Customer Service requester** creates a GitHub issue in the `SP7` repo and adds it to the **current milestone**.
3. The assigned developer will:
   - Handle the request on their support day.
   - Provide a brief summary of how the issue was resolved.
   - Ensure that **no user-identifiable information** is disclosed.
4. Only the **Customer Service requester** may close the issue once it is confirmed as resolved.

## Request Prioritization

Requests will be prioritized based on:

- Severity and urgency of the issue  
- Client’s subscription level  
- Whether the issue is caused by our system  
- Impact on the user’s ability to work in Specify  
- Frequency of use of the affected functionality  

Users will be informed of the expected **week** their issue will be addressed, with the understanding that it may be **delayed by one week** if necessary.

## Note

If the issue is determined to be caused by **our system or a recent update**, it will be **addressed immediately**, regardless of the developer support schedule.
