Make sure it is working correctly—this is essential for debugging and testing backend changes.

### 🔑 Test Panel Access

- Contact the relevant team members to generate the necessary API keys and credentials
- Create a new instance and test it
- Download a database

### 🧪 User Testing Requirement

For your first two weeks, dedicate 3 hours per day to using the Specify application as a user. The goal is to:
- Learn user workflows
- Understand common pain points
- Explore different modules and features hands-on

➡️ Important: For each tool or component you explore, write down any questions or uncertainties you encounter. These will be discussed during your daily manager meeting. Your manager will either answer them directly or direct you to the appropriate team member.

### 🔍 Testing Tasks

You will also gain familiarity with our testing practices by:

- Reviewing and testing 4–5 pull requests (PRs) assigned by your manager. These PRs will include testing instructions to help you understand how features are validated.
- Going through the general testing checklist at the end of the second week for an item or row selected by your manager.

### 🗓️ Daily Check-Ins

You are expected to meet daily with your manager to:
- Review tasks for the following day
- Share feedback on how your current day went
- Ask any questions or raise blockers early
