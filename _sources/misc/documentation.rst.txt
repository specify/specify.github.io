Informatics Documentation
############################

There are several options for appropriate documentation, depending on the issue.

Specify code repositories
==========================

Document issues, bugs, tasks, solutions in the appropriate Specify code repository
under https://github.com/specify .  These are best for issues
directly tied to modules in the Specify codebase.

specify.github.io
===================

Document reference materials in this internal documentation website.  This includes:
project goals, design, implementation strategy, reasoning behind decisions,
maintenance procedures, staff/student expectations, etc.

This site contains testing documentation, such as procedures, database
descriptions, checklists and templates.

This site also acts as a historical record, allowing us access to older considerations
that we do not want to overlook.

The repository is public, though not advertised, so restrict documentation to
non-proprietary information (do not include proposal ideas, passwords, etc.).


specify-development issue repository
======================================

Document technical, but non-code related issues in
https://github.com/specify/specify-development.  Include details such as requirements,
related components, database, etc.

Google docs
============
Document meeting notes and works-in-progress needing continual updates by multiple
people here.  Documentation that is complete, and to be retained for future access
should be moved to specify.github.io.  After moving a document to specify.github.io,
remove it from Google Docs so that it is not updated further there - additional edits
may be made in specify.github.io.

TBD password manager
================================
