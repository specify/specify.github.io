# Specify Data Migration Agreement

This Migration Service Agreement (Migration Agreement) is made and entered into by and
between Specify Collections Consortium (SCC) and the Customer for the purpose of
migrating Customer’s data (Collection Data) from Customer’s current data platform
(Source Data) into Specify Software. This Migration Agreement is an amendment to any
Agreement between Customer and SCC.

# Project Scope

SCC will perform migration services for Customer (Migration Project), as outlined in
this Migration Agreement and the Data Migration Scope (DMS). The SCC and Customer shall
agree on a Migration Workplan within a specified time period after the Migration
Agreement has been activated. This shall serve as the entire scope for the Migration
Project (Migration Project Scope) to which SCC commits under the terms of this Migration
Agreement.

# Migration Workplan

The Migration Workplan specifies how the SCC will accomplish the Data Migration defined
in the DMS.  The Customer and the SCC will agree on the parameters of the Migration
Workplan within a specified time after the Migration Agreement has been signed.  The
Migration Workplan will include the following, for each database:

* Collections to be included in each;
* Division of data within the hierarchical structure Collections, Disciplines,
  Divisions, and Types, to be defined and populated by the Source Data;
* Mapping between the Source Data and Specify schema;
* Collecting Event relationship to Collection Object;
* Paleo Context relationship to Locality, Collecting Event, or Collection Object;
* Existence and definition of Collection Relationships;
* Formatting for dates and Identifiers;
* Approximate completion dates for data migration steps, including expected response
  time for Customer approval or feedback;

  * SCC response to Customer feedback will naturally push following dates forward.
  * Inaccurate or incomplete configuration requirements may result in Additional Fees.

# Price and Time Estimate

Customer agrees and acknowledges that Data Migration Fee and Time estimate may be
increased during the course of Migration Project in the event Migration Project
requirements exceed the specifications allowed for in Migration Project Scope. This can
result from underestimation of labor and/or complexity including but not limited to:

* Unexpected large volumes of Migrated Data;
* Undiscovered data complexity or inconsistency;
* Undisclosed workflows;
* Delays in:

  * Source data availability
  * Customer feedback and/or approvals
  * Other unforeseen delays

* Unique technical requirements

Should the Customer decide to terminate the Migration Project at any point during the
project, all agreed upon fees shall still be due and payable to SCC.

# Customer Project Responsibilities

In addition to responsibilities set forth in the DMS, Agreement, or any amendment
thereto, Customer agrees and acknowledges that Customer shall:

* Cooperate and provide reasonable assistance during Migration Project and/or as
  reasonably requested by SCC;
* Designate a Point Person for receipt of any and all of SCC’s operational
  communications regarding Migration Project and transmission of Customer’s Migration
  Project decisions, information, approvals, and/or acceptance; provide prior written
  notice of any Point Person change, and to use reasonable efforts to minimize any such
  change;
* Provide the complete dataset to be converted before the Migration Project begins.

  * Clean and standardize data before providing it to SCC for migration;
  * Provide a list of all standardized values requested for controlled vocabularies;

* Refrain from making change(s) and/or revision(s) to any Migrated Data during Migration
  Project, with the exception of modifications agreed upon by the SCC and Customer;
* Participate in creating a Migration Plan specifying the Data Mapping and configuration
  details for the finished Migrated Data;
* Understand and accept that Additional Fees may apply if Customer changes the
  configuration requirements stipulated in the Migration Workplan (including but not
  limited to: data mapping, data relationships, database configuration, form layout) of
  the Migration Agreement;
* Promptly and thoroughly test Migrated Data;
* Report any and all errors to SCC discovered during testing, including instructions to
  demonstrate how the error can be reproduced and, if applicable, visual examples
  (i.e. screenshots) of such;
* Understand and acknowledge that should Customer fail to promptly/thoroughly complete
  migration testing responsibilities, a complete re-migration may be required, for
  which Customer will have to pay Additional Fees;
* Understand and accept that Additional Fees may apply if Customer requires SCC to
  resolve user errors;
* Understand and accept that SCC’s responsibilities and obligations as set forth herein
  are dependent upon, among other things, the accuracy, assumptions, and representations
  made by Customer, the timeliness of Customer’s decisions, and the timeliness of
  Customer’s performance of Customer’s responsibilities and obligations;

SCC’s nonperformance shall be excused if such nonperformance stems from Customer’s
failure to perform Customer’s responsibilities and/or obligations, both express and
implied, as set forth herein. Customer agrees and acknowledges that in the event of
Customer’s failure to perform, SCC has NO DUTY to incur additional costs (including but
not limited to labor and software/hardware costs) in performing its obligations under
the Agreement or investigate Customer’s failure to perform. Should Customer fail to
perform, Customer agrees to pay SCC the estimated cost set forth in the DMS and
acknowledges and agrees that this is fair and reasonable.

# SCC Project Responsibilities

In addition to responsibilities set forth in the DMS, Agreement, or any amendment
thereto, SCC agrees and acknowledges that SCC shall:

* Request, obtain, and verify Source Data access according to Migration Assessment Plan
  specifications;
* Set up Migration Instance for data verification;
* Oversee and administer Migration Project;
* Set up a project management board and provide access to Point Person;
* Set up and reconfigure Migrated Data, according to Migration Project Scope, and
  restore on Migration Instance;
* Perform cursory initial review of Migrated Data;
* Provide an estimated timeline and Migration Workplan for Migration Project;
* Provide Customer the opportunity to thoroughly test and verify operating functionality
  of Migrated Data;
* Provide a complete Specify backup, including all data and configuration files required
  for a fully functional, fully populated instantiation on the Specify Cloud or a
  Customer-hosted server.

SCC will make every effort to allow continuous access to Migrated Data during the
Migration Project, but downtime for the Migration Instance during the Migration Project
should be expected. Customer will not modify Source or Migration Instance data during
the Project unless agreed upon in advance.

SCC migrates data as is.  SCC is not responsible for errors or inconsistencies in the
data.

# Data Ownership

The SCC makes no claim of ownership to Customer collection data and will not use or
distribute such data without express written permission of Customer.
