Developer Expectations
########################

Student developers:
=======================

* Attend student developer meetings.
* Work in the office at least 50% of the time.

Staff and Student Developers:
==================

Planning
-------------

* This project has many interlocking parts and dependencies, and requires the team to
  work closely together to ensure that dependencies are met in a timely manner.
* Respect deadlines and complete tasks within the agreed timeframe.
* Define realistic timelines for new features you accept.
* Commit to projects that you start working on.

Support and Maintenance Tasks
-------------

* Developers should never directly receive any user-support requests, if that happens,
  please bring it to your supervisor.  User issues should be created by the user-support
  team in the specify-development repository.
* When asked to work on user issues or test panel bugs etc (anything that is not a part
  of the milestones or specify7 issue repo):

  * Ask the requester to create an issue on the specify-development repo or create one
    yourself.  Include details such as requirements, related components and/or database.
  * Assign yourself to it
  * Verify with your supervisor the priority.
  * Define together a time to work on the new issue.

* With some exceptions, delay response to user or user-support requests for at least
  24 hours to allow users to work out the problem themselves.

Development Tasks
-------------

* When starting work on an issue/branch, check in even unfinished code changes
  regularly.  Mark as unfinished when applicable.
* Do not comment on code until you are personally tagged as a reviewer, or the entire
  dev group is tagged.  If new code is added after your review, wait for a new request
  to be sent.
* Thoroughly test PRs with more general testing procedures before sending for review.
  Do not skip previously-passing tests after changes, as some bugs come back to life.
* Write detailed instructions for testers, possibly adding to the testing instructions
  after changes.
* Complete individual PRs to the “request testing” stage before moving on to another
  issue.
* Respond to requests for changes on PRs as soon as possible, sometimes setting aside
  newer issues or other assigned tasks.

Communication
-------------

* Communicate clearly, respectfully, and in a timely manner on all code issues.  Offer
  improvements in code reviews or in meetings, not in isolation.
* Offer alternate implementation strategies at the appropriate time in the development
  cycle.  Do not disrupt the process after a decision has been made.
* If you are not sure of the best course of action on a complex issue, call a meeting
  with other developers to talk out the implications of different solutions.
* If a strategy agreed on by a group proves inadequate, discuss with the group before
  changing course.
* Meetings with the development group are preferable to extensive discussion on GitHub
  or Slack.  After the meeting, provide an appropriate summary on GitHub.
* Always write clear and concise summaries of the issues AND the agreed-upon solutions
  on Github or the appropriate platform.
* When appropriate, fully document the reasoning behind complex decisions in writing.
  This historical record will help our development process in general, so that if we
  choose to modify or refactor something, we do not overlook considerations that went
  into the original design.
* Act as a mentor to newer (staff or student) developers.  Follow up verbal interaction
  with some type of documentation.  Write an explanatory email or document, as well as
  pointing to any relevant code.
* Provide adequate written/verbal notice to your supervisor, as well as adding events
  on the shared calendar, before taking vacation time.  Some time periods may not be
  approved (though rarely) if there are important deadlines or meetings for which
  rescheduling is impossible.
