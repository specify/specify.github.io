* Other notes:

    * All of the forms are heavily edited.
    * Anthro, Minerals, Rocks and Shell collections all have very strange trees that cause API link error. This is expected.
    * Paleo Context exists in Anthro and Minerals, but cannot be accessed from Collection Object or Locality.
    * Data Entry list has Chronostratigraphy in Insect, but nothing to use it with. Choosing this option causes an “Unable to get tree ranks” error.
    * All of the Mammalogy, Entomology, etc. taxon trees skip past Kingdom and Phylum, which causes an API link error. This is fine since it’s a user error issue with the tree being badly formed.
    * Minerals and Rocks are very similar and seem to have the same loan records, however, Rocks has Paleo Context.
