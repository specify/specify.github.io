Discipline support
#####################

Specify collections management software was designed, and continues to support all
natural history discipline types.

Specify has recently added support for geology
collections, with functionality and tables that support geology, but are also relevant
to biological collections.

Our data model is extremely customizable so the databases can be adapted for
different disciplines and individual collectionsâ€™ workflows.  The SCC currently has
members using Specify software for the following collections (and many subdisciplines
within them):

* Arachnology
* Arthropods
* Botany

  * Biocultural Collection
  * Bryophytes
  * Cryptogamic Botany
  * Diatoms
