Data Migration

Conventional migrations

Large-scale migrations
************************
With a large-scale consortium of collections such as a country-wide effort ("Country
Consortium"), the SCC team is unable to provide the resources necessary for data
migration of multiple institutions and collections.  In such cases we suggest the
Country Consortium hire in-house staff familiar with relational databases to lead and
execute data migration to Specify. This “Migration team” would become expertly familiar
with Specify’s data model, behavior and user interfaces, plus understand institutional
collection data workflows, local user requirements, and expectations of the
collections staff.

This Migration team would create a plan and a timeline for data migration, typically
based on institutional priorities, legacy data quality, and data complexity and size.
The Migration team would also be responsible for reviewing and cleaning data to be
imported according to collection requirements and database settings, customizing the
Specify application according to the collection requirements, and then importing data
via Specify’s Workbench tool, Specify’s API, or with SQL scripts directly into the
backend Specify database (MariaDB).  SCC staff would work with the Migration team to
choose specific processing options and methods for data migrations.

SCC technical staff will train the Point Person and Migration team involved in database
setup and data migration to understand Specify at the Support level. The contacts should plan to allocate a week to visit our SCC headquarters in Kansas. There they would work intensively one-on-one with our technical support staff and software engineers to attain a database administrator level of mastery. After the visit, SCC staff will continue to meet with the person or team as needed over Zoom to discuss questions and to research and resolve issues that arise. The Buyer would be responsible for their staff travel expenses, the SCC will allocate staff time and project resources at no cost.
We can facilitate meetings with other large national organizations who have undergone the same process of assessing collections’ requirements, deciding on configuration and customization options, preparing data for migration, and then importing data into Specify. We have worked with several organizations of a similar size and scale in transitions to Specify including: the Danish Natural History Museums, the Canadian Laurentian Forestry Centre, and the Australian federal government’s CSIRO. Each member has taken a somewhat custom transition to move to Specify based on the organization of local technical expertise and desired outcomes.
